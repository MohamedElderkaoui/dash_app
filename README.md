# dash_app

A Dash application built with Python. This repository provides a modular example of a Dash application, demonstrating best practices in code organization by separating the app initialization, layout, callbacks, and data loading logic.

## Features

- **Modular Design:**  
  - **`app.py`**: Main application entry point.  
  - **`layout.py`**: Contains the Dash layout and UI components.  
  - **`callbacks.py`**: Holds the callback functions to update the UI dynamically.  
  - **`data_loader.py`**: Responsible for loading and processing data.
- **Containerization:**  
  A Dockerfile is provided to containerize the application.
- **Development Environment:**  
  A Vagrantfile is included to set up a consistent development environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- Additional dependencies as listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

> **Note:** There is also a file named `requitement.txt`. Ensure you install dependencies from the correct file if needed.

## Installation

### Using a Virtual Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedElderkaoui/dash_app.git
   cd dash_app
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t dash_app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8050:8050 dash_app
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050).

### Using Vagrant

1. **Ensure [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is installed.**
2. **Start the Vagrant environment:**

   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

   This sets up a virtual machine with all necessary dependencies for development.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the Dash application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8050](http://127.0.0.1:8050) to see the app in action.
